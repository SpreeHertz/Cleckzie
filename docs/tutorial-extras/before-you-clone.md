# Before you clone 

Cloning Cleckzie is cool, but it is recommended that you have at least a *little* knowledge about JavaScript. The reason why is because while coding, you **will** hit simple unexpected errors. So, you can just fix it with your JavaScript knowledge. You may also be interested in modifying Cleckzie. This will also be way easier if you learn it.

 There are websites like [W3Schools](https://w3schools.org), [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org) and many more to help you learn JavaScript.
