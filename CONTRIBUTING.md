# What to do
Make sure that whatever you contribute works with Cleckzie's command handler (See example file [here](https://github.com/SpreeHertz/Cleckzie/blob/master/SlashCommands/fun/hug.js])).

# What not to do
• Commands (includes Slash commands and messageCreate commands) should **not contain anything that is NSFW.** Swear words are allowed but not too much. <br>
• It's recommended to follow ESLint rules, and use comments. <br>
• Make sure that whatever you make **does not** abuse the Discord API. It should not hit the rate limits.
